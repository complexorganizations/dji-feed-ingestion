## Overview

GitHub Actions help automate tasks within your software development life cycle. The workflows in this directory are configured to run on specific triggers, such as a push or pull request to specific branches.

## Workflows

### Build and Test

- **File**: `build-and-test.yml`
- **Trigger**: On every push and pull request to the `main` branch.
- **Purpose**: This workflow compiles the code, runs unit tests, and ensures that the code adheres to the coding standards.

### Deployment

- **File**: `deploy.yml`
- **Trigger**: On every push to the `main` branch after successful build and test.
- **Purpose**: This workflow deploys the latest version of the application to the specified environment.

## Usage

To use these workflows:

1. Ensure you have the necessary secrets set up in your GitHub repository. These might include API keys, deployment credentials, etc.
2. Push code or create a pull request to the `main` branch. The workflows will trigger automatically based on their configurations.
