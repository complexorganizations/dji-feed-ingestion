## Overview

The DJI Feed Ingestion infrastructure is designed to be scalable, resilient, and efficient. It leverages cloud-native services and best practices to ensure smooth ingestion and processing of DJI feeds.

## Prerequisites

- Cloud provider CLI (e.g., AWS CLI, GCP CLI) installed and configured.
- Terraform v0.14+ installed.
- Appropriate permissions to create and manage cloud resources.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/complexorganizations/dji-feed-ingestion
   cd dji-feed-ingestion/infrastructure/
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Update Configuration**

   Modify the `terraform.tfvars` file to match your environment and requirements.

## Deployment
